## Description
Welcome to my wild adventure! ðŸš€ This is the Quake3 Kubernetes/Openshift Operator, a MARVELous (ðŸ¤£) creation I've forged with NestJS. My mission? To show that developing Kubernetes operators in TypeScript isn't just a dreamâ€”it's a reality!

This operator is still a bit of a beautiful mess. It's my unfinished masterpiece with a long to-do list. But don't let that stop you! I'm adding an elegant Angular frontend, some handy REST APIs, and working to make it look fantastic. Inspired by the Minio operator, this is only the beginning!

So, join me, test it with Kubernetes in Docker (kind), and let's build something unforgettable.
## Installation

```bash
$ pnpm install
```

## Running the app

```bash
# For the daredevils (development mode)
$ pnpm run start

# For the watchful eyes (watch mode)
$ pnpm run start:dev

# For the serious ones (production mode)
$ pnpm run start:prod
```

## Test

Who needs test?

ONE DAY: 

```bash
# unit tests
$ pnpm run test

# e2e tests
$ pnpm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ pnpm run test:cov
```
## Dreaming Big: The OperatorHub

I'm not just building this for fun (well, maybe a little). My dream is to publish this operator on OperatorHub, making it accessible to the whole Kubernetes community! ðŸŽ‰ I'm working hard (really?) to make that dream come true, and I'd love for you to be a part of it. Stay tuned (clicking the star is free, but remember to remove notification, GH spams so much)!
